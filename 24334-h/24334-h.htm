<span class="i2">You cast a shoe, and at this dusty Dragon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where beast and man were equal on the sign,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Inquired at once for Blacksmith and for flagon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The landlord showed you, while you drank your hops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A road-side break beyond the straggling shops.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so directed, thereupon you led<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your halting roadster to a kind of pass,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then a dog growled; and straightway there began<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A goat burst out, escaping from the can;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, following close, rose slowly into sight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blind of one eye, and black with toil and tan&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An uncouth, limping, heavy-shouldered man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Half filled with goat's milk, silently he drew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An anvil forth, and reaching shoe and nail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bared a red forearm, bringing into view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anchors and hearts in shadowy tattoo.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then he lit his fire.... But I dispense<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Henceforth with you, my Reader, and your horse,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">To bring an awkward hero in perforce;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since this our smith, for reasons never known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To most society preferred his own.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Women declared that he'd an "Evil Eye,"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This in a sense was true&mdash;he had but one;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">We sometimes say so of the friends we shun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, wrong or right, suffices to affirm it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cyclops lived a veritable hermit,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dwelling below the cliff, beside the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Caved like an ancient British Troglodyte,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Milking his goat at eve, and it may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Spearing the fish along the flats at night,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until, at last, one April evening mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to the Inn a Lady and a Child.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Lady was a nullity; the Child<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One of those bright bewitching little creatures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, if she once but shyly looked and smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would soften out the ruggedest of features;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fragile and slight,&mdash;a very fay for size,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pale town-cheeks, and "clear germander eyes."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nurses, no doubt, might name her "somewhat wild;"<br /></span>

<span class="i2">She needed "cultivation;"&mdash;all I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is that whene'er she spoke, or laughed, or romped, you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt in each act the beauty of impromptu.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Lady was a nullity&mdash;a pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nerveless and pulseless quasi-invalid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, lest the ozone should in aught avail,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Remained religiously indoors to read;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that, in wandering at her will, the Child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did, in reality, run "somewhat wild."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At first but peering at the sanded floor<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And great shark jaw-bone in the cosy bar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then watching idly from the dusky door,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The noisy advent of a coach or car;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stealing out to wonder at the fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blistered Ajax by the garden gate,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some old ship's figure-head&mdash;until at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Straying with each excursion more and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She reached the limits of the road, and passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Plucking the pansies, downward to the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, as you, respected Reader, showed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to the smith's "desirable abode."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There by the cave the occupant she found,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Weaving a crate; and, with a gladsome cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dog frisked out, although the Cyclops frowned<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With all the terrors of his single eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from a mound came running, too, the goat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uttering her plaintive, desultory note.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Child stood wondering at the silent man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Doubtful to go or stay, when presently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She felt a plucking, for the goat began<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To crop the trail of twining briony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She held behind her; so that, laughing, she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned her light steps, retreating, to the sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the goat followed her on eager feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And therewithal an air so grave and mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coupled with such a deprecatory bleat<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of injured confidence, that soon the Child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled the lone shore with louder merriment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And e'en the Cyclops' heavy brow unbent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus grew acquaintanceship between the pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The girl and goat;&mdash;for thenceforth, day by day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Child would bring her four-foot friend such fare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As might be gathered on the downward way:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foxglove, or broom, and "yellow cytisus,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear to all goats since Greek Theocritus.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, for the Cyclops, that misogynist<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Having, by stress of circumstances, smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt it at least incumbent to resist<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Further encroachment, and as one beguiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By adverse fortune, with the half-door shut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwelt in the dim seclusion of his hut.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And yet not less from thence he still must see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That daily coming, and must hear the goat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bleating her welcome; then, towards the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The happy voices of the playmates float;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until, at last, enduring it no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took his wonted station by the door.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here was, of course, a pitiful surrender;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For soon the Child, on whom the Evil Eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to exert an influence but slender,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would run to question him, till, by and by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His moody humor like a cloud dispersing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He found himself uneasily conversing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That was a sow's-ear, that an egg of skate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And this an agate rounded by the wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came inquiries still more intimate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">About himself, the anvil, and the cave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, at last, the Child, without alarm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would even spell the letters on his arm.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">G&mdash;a&mdash;l</span>&mdash;<em>Galatea</em>." So there grew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On his part, like some half-remembered tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The new-found memory of an ice-bound crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And vague garrulities of spouting whale,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sea-cow basking upon berg and floe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Polar light, and stunted Eskimo.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Till, in his heart, which hitherto had been<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Locked as those frozen barriers of the North,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came once more the season of the green,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The tender bud-time and the putting forth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that the man, before the new sensation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt for the child a kind of adoration;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rising by night, to search for shell and flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To lay in places where she found them first;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoarding his cherished goat's milk for the hour<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When those young lips might feel the summer's thirst;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding himself for all devotion paid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By that clear laughter of the little maid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dwelling, alas! in that fond Paradise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where no to-morrow quivers in suspense,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where scarce the changes of the sky suffice<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To break the soft forgetfulness of sense,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where dreams become realities; and where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I willingly would leave him&mdash;did I dare.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet for a little space it still endured,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Until, upon a day when least of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The softened Cyclops, by his hopes assured,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dreamed the inevitable blow could fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came the stern moment that should all destroy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bringing a pert young cockerel of a Boy.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Middy, I think,&mdash;he'd "<em>Acis</em>" on his box:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A black-eyed, sun-burnt, mischief-making imp,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pet of the mess,&mdash;a Puck with curling locks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who straightway travestied the Cyclops' limp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And marveled how his cousin so could care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such a "one-eyed, melancholy Bear."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus there was war at once; not overt yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For still the Child, unwilling, would not break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The new acquaintanceship, nor quite forget<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The pleasant past; while, for his treasure's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boding smith with clumsy efforts tried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win the laughing scorner to his side.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There are some sights pathetic; none I know<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More sad than this: to watch a slow-wrought mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humbling itself, for love, to come and go<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before some petty tyrant of its kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saddest, ah!&mdash;saddest far,&mdash;when it can do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naught to advance the end it has in view.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This was at least the Cyclops' case, until,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whether the boy beguiled the Child away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or whether that limp Matron on the Hill<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Woke from her novel-reading trance, one day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He waited long and wearily in vain,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, from that hour, they never came again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet still he waited, hoping&mdash;wondering if<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They still might come, or dreaming that he heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sound of far-off voices on the cliff,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or starting strangely when the she-goat stirred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nothing broke the silence of the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, from that hour, the Child returned no more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Therefore our Cyclops sorrowed,&mdash;not as one<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who can command the gamut of despair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as a man who feels his days are done,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So dead they seem,&mdash;so desolately bare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, though he'd lived a hermit, 'twas but only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now he discovered that his life was lonely.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The very sea seemed altered, and the shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The very voices of the air were dumb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time was an emptiness that o'er and o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ticked with the dull pulsation "Will she come?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that he sat "consuming in a dream,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much like his old forerunner, Polypheme.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Until there came the question, "Is she gone?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With such sad sick persistence that at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urged by the hungry thought which drove him on,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Along the steep declivity he passed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the summit panting stood, and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as the horn was sounding on the hill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, in a dream, beside the "Dragon" door,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The smith saw travellers standing in the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the horn again, and three or four<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Looked idly at him from the roof, but One,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Child within,&mdash;suffused with sudden shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrust forth a hand, and called to him by name.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus the coach vanished from his sight, but he<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Limped back with bitter pleasure in his pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was not all forgotten&mdash;could it be?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet the knowledge made the memory vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then&mdash;he felt a pressure in his throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, for that night, forgot to milk his goat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What then might come of silent misery,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What new resolvings then might intervene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not. Only, with the morning sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The goat stood tethered on the "Dragon" green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those who, wondering, questioned thereupon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found the hut empty,&mdash;for the man was gone.<br /></span>

<h3>INCOGNITA.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just for a space that I met her&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just for a day in the train!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It began when she feared it would wet her,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That tiniest spurtle of rain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we tucked a great rug in the sashes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And carefully padded the pane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I sorrow in sackcloth and ashes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Longing to do it again!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then it grew when she begged me to reach her<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A dressing-case under the seat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was "really so tiny a creature,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That she needed a stool for her feet!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was promptly arranged to her order<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a care that was even minute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a glimpse&mdash;of an open-work border,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a glance&mdash;of the fairyest boot.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then it drooped, and revived at some hovels&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Were they houses for men or for pigs?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then it shifted to muscular novels,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a little digression on prigs:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thought "Wives and Daughters" "so jolly;"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Had I read it?" She knew when I had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the rest, I should dote upon "Molly;"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And "poor Mrs. Gaskell&mdash;how sad!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like Browning?" "But so-so." His proof lay<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Too deep for her frivolous mood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That preferred your mere metrical <em>souffl&eacute;</em><br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the stronger poetical food;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet at times he was good&mdash;"as a tonic:"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was Tennyson writing just now?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was this new poet Byronic,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And clever, and naughty, or how?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then we trifled with concerts and croqu&ecirc;t,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then she daintily dusted her face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she sprinkled herself with "Ess Bouquet,"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fished out from the foregoing case;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we chattered of Gassier and Grisi,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And voted Aunt Sally a bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discussed if the tight rope were easy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or Chopin much harder than Spohr.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And oh! the odd things that she quoted,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the prettiest possible look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the price of two buns that she noted<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the prettiest possible book;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">While her talk like a musical rillet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Flashed on with the hours that flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the carriage, her smile seemed to fill it<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With just enough summer&mdash;for Two.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Till at last in her corner, peeping<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From a nest of rugs and of furs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the white shut eyelids sleeping<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On those dangerous looks of hers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seemed like a snow-drop breaking,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not wholly alive nor dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with one blind impulse making<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the sounds of the spring overhead;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I watched in the lamplight's swerving<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The shade of the down-dropt lid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lip-line's delicate curving,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where a slumbering smile lay hid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I longed that, rather than sever,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The train should shriek into space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carry us onward&mdash;for ever,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Me and that beautiful face.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But she suddenly woke in a fidget,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With fears she was "nearly at home,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And talk of a certain Aunt Bridget,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whom I mentally wished&mdash;well, at Rome;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Got out at the very next station,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Looking back with a merry <em>Bon Soir</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adding, too, to my utter vexation,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A surplus, unkind <em>Au Revoir</em>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So left me to muse on her graces,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To dose and to muse, till I dreamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we sailed through the sunniest places<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In a glorified galley, it seemed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the cabin was made of a carriage,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the ocean was Eau-de-Cologne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we split on a rock labelled <span class="smcap">Marriage</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I woke,&mdash;as cold as a stone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And that's how I lost her&mdash;a jewel,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><em>Incognita</em>&mdash;one in a crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor prudent enough to be cruel,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor worldly enough to be proud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was just a shut lid and its lashes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just a few hours in a train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I sorrow in sackcloth and ashes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Longing to see her again.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You've a sword at your side, in your shoes there are buckles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the folds of fine linen flap over your knuckles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have come with light heart, and with eyes that are brighter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From a pint of red Port, and a steak at the Mitre;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have strolled from the Bar and the purlieus of Fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you turn from the Strand into Catherine Street;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence climb to the law-loving summits of Bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till you stand at the Portal all play-goers know.<br /></span>

<p>"<em>To brandish the poles of that old Sedan Chair!</em>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Page</span> <a href="#Page_7">7</a>.</p>

<p>A friendly critic, whose versatile pen it is not easy to mistake,
recalls, <em>&agrave;-propos</em> of the above, the following passage from Moli&egrave;re,
which shows that Chairmen are much the same all the world over:&mdash;</p>

<p>1 Porteur (prenant un des b&acirc;tons de sa chaise). <em>&Ccedil;&agrave;, payez-nous
vitement!</em><br />

Mascarille. <em>Quoi!</em><br />

1 Porteur. <em>Je dis que je veux avoir de l'argent tout &agrave; l'heure.</em><br />

Mascarille. <em>Il est raisonnable, celui-l&agrave;,</em> etc.</p>

<p class="break">"<em>It has waited by portals where Garrick has played.</em>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Page</span> <a href="#Page_8">8</a>.</p>

<p>According to Mrs. Carter (Smith's <em>Nollekens</em>, 1828, i. 211), when
Garrick acted, the hackney-chairs often stood "all round the Piazzas
[Covent Garden], down Southampton-Street, and extended more than
half-way along Maiden-Lane."</p>


<p class="break">"<em>A skill Pr&eacute;ville could not disown.</em>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Page</span> <a href="#Page_23">23</a>.</p>

<p>Pr&eacute;ville was the French Foote, <em>circa</em> 1760. His gifts as a comedian
were of the highest order; and he had an extraordinary faculty for
identifying himself with the parts he played. Sterne, in a letter to
Garrick from Paris, in 1762, calls him "Mercury himself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>


<p class="break"><span class="smcap">Molly Trefusis.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Page</span> <a href="#Page_32">32</a>.</p>

<p>The epigram here quoted from "an old magazine" is to be found in the
late Lord Neaves's admirable little volume, <em>The Greek Anthology</em>
(<em>Blackwood's Ancient Classics for English Readers</em>). Those familiar
with eighteenth-century literature will recognize in the succeeding
verses but another echo of those lively stanzas of John Gay to "Molly
Mogg of the Rose," which found so many imitators in his own day. Whether
my heroine is to be identified with a certain "Miss Trefusis," whose
<em>Poems</em> are sometimes to be found in the second-hand booksellers'
catalogues, I know not. But if she is, I trust I have done her
accomplished shade no wrong.</p>

<p>The initials "E. H. P." are those of the late eminent (and ill-fated)
Orientalist, Professor Palmer. As my lines entirely owed their origin to
his translations of Zoheir, I sent them to him. He was indulgent enough
to praise them warmly. It is true he found anachronisms; but as he said
these would cause no disturbance to orthodox Persians, I concluded I had
succeeded in my little <em>pastiche</em>, and, with his permission, inscribed
it to him. I wish now that it had been a more worthy tribute to one of
the most erudite and versatile scholars this age has seen.</p>

<p>These verses were suggested by the recollection of an anecdote in Madame

It was therefore somewhat depressing, not long after they were written,
to find that the subject had already been annexed in the <em>Tatler</em> by an
actual eighteenth-century writer, who, moreover, claimed to have founded
his story on a contemporary incident. Burton, nevertheless, had told it
before him, as early as 1621, in the <em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em>.</p>
